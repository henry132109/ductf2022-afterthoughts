# Post-CTF thoughts

First of all, **thank all organizers** for this wonderful event! The challenges are fun and interesting and the people there are really nice and helpful.

## One day behind

I didn't intend to play at first because I read that "the event starts at 09:30" - *I'd be like 10h behind*! While having a family day I realized it was **UTC** :facepalm:. Timezone is the bane of my existence =/

## Difficulty

While it's still beginner-friendly, this seems harder than Cyber Apocalypse, another CTF I played earlier this year. For crypto, *no typical RSAs, the "custom cipher" and "block cipher" challenges are less typical*. For Web, *no more silly sql injection and IDORs*. For reverse and pwn, *I'm weak as always*. The blockchain and OSINT category are new to me. While I completed most of the OSINT challenges, I'm generally unfamiliar with blockchains ~plus I hate their carbon footprints~. The bright side is I had a lot to learn :smile:

## Playing solo

There are time sinkholes in this challenge that prove to be fatal for solo players. I could have been more decisive in giving up the question *cough cough Google Map* entirely.

## Other thoughts

- I'm still reluctant in using bruteforcing tools, thinking it'll be slow and have other concerns; *IT WAS FAST* (<1s)
- I only had 5 minutes left when I learnt of the solution to the non-se

### Favorite solved levels

- Oracle for Block Cipher Enthusiasts - the situation is not very practical so it really needs some drawing-the-diagram-out.
- JS Lock (Reversing) - finally it isn't beautifiers and web assembly. I used `JSON.stringify` to search at first, which turned out to be too slow.

### Favorite unsolved levels

- Last digit - who doesn't *love* the [recent Python update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTucYT2LpNU).

### Least favorite solved levels

- Treasure Hunt - there are a lot of implicit assumptions for a challenge without source code.

### Least favorite unsolved levels

- Pre-Kebab whatever - we all know why
